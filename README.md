# A Bird's Eye View

## Description

This is a fully responsive full stack application allowing users, more specifically bird lovers/watchers to post and share their sighting with the community. We wanted to give a space to empower users and encourage an engaging atmosphere with a community of fellow bird watchers.

We learned building a full stack application was much harder than we thought! Even with four collaborators. There are a lot of moving parts. Adding, removing, updating, or changing can break the chain and cause a lot of issues. Also, getting everything to connect was a huge issue. For some of our team members, it's harder for them to visual see how everything connect during the creation. Once the application was complete, then it made it easier for them to see.
